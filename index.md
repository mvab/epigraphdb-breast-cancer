### Abstract

An increasing challenge in population health research is efficiently integrating evidence from a wealth of new data that could provide opportunities to understand the causes of disease. The use of biomedical data integration platforms can facilitate evidence triangulation from different sources, improving confidence in causal relationships of interest. In this work, we aimed to integrate Mendelian randomization (MR) and literature-mined evidence from EpiGraphDB to build a comprehensive overview of risk factors for developing breast cancer.

We utilised MR-EvE (“Everything-vs-Everything”) data to generate a list of causal risk factors for breast cancer. We then integrated this data with literature-mined relationships for risk factors to dissect how they may be linked to breast cancer, allowing us to identify potential mediators. We used multivariable MR to separate the direct effects of these traits as a mediation validation step. We identified 213 novel and established lifestyle and molecular traits with evidence of an effect on breast cancer. We present the results of evidence integration for four case studies (IGF-1, cardiotrophin-1, childhood obesity and age at menopause). 

We demonstrate that using MR-EvE to identify disease risk factors is an efficient hypothesis-generating approach. Moreover, we show that integrating MR evidence with literature-mined data may identify causal intermediates and uncover the mechanisms behind observed effects.
